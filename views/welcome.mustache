    <h1>Welcome to the Mystery Word game.</h1>

    <p>The computer will select a word at random for you to guess.</p>

    <p>You may then guess a letter to see if it appears in the word. If it does, those letters will be revealed.</p>

    <p>If it does not, you will lose one guess.</p>

    <p>You win if you can guess all the letters with less than 8 incorrect guesses.</p>
